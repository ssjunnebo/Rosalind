Inferring Protein from Spectrum

Problem

The prefix spectrum of a weighted string is the collection of all its prefix weights.

Given: A list L of n (n≤100) positive real numbers.

Return: A protein string of length n−1 whose prefix spectrum is equal to L (if multiple solutions exist, you may output any one of them). Consult the monoisotopic mass table.
